- **Book Cataloging**: Add and manage books with details such as title and author.
- **Borrow Records**: Track which users have borrowed which books and their respective return dates.
- **Rating System**: Allow users to rate books and manage these ratings efficiently.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity through extensive validation and constraints.
- **API Endpoints**: Expose RESTful API endpoints for integration with other systems or frontend applications.
